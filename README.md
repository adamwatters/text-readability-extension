# Text Readability Extension

Description:

This extension color codes text based on readability according to the The Flesch Reading Ease formula. Each sentence is colorized according to the difficulty of body of the text up to and including the sentence. The idea was to match the tool to the way a person would evaluate the text - ie sequentially.

Text colors are on a green to red gradient, with green corresponding to easier-to-read and red to more-difficult-to-read. On hover, VSCode will display the numerical difficulty score for both the individual sentence and of the entire text up to and including the sentence.
